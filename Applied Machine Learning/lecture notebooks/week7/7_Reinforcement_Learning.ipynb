Through a combination of supervised learning from human expert games and reinforcement learning by playing against itself, AlphaGo hones its skills and adapts its gameplay. This reinforcement learning process allows AlphaGo to refine its moves, prioritise winning strategies, and continuously evolve, eventually achieving superhuman proficiency in the intricate game of Go. The result is a monumental breakthrough in the world of AI and a testament to the power of reinforcement learning in conquering complex challenges. "
