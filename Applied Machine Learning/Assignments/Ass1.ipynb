    "# Assessment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first assessed mini-project. When electrons $(e^-)$ and positrons $(e^+)$ collide together they sometimes produce two muons $(\\mu^- , \\mu^+)$ that come out of the collision back-to-back. The angle between the incoming $e^+$ and the outgoing $\\mu^+$ is defined to be $\\theta$. See the figure below:\n",
    "![simple_drawing.png](attachment:simple_drawing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the energy of the $e^-e^+$ collision is a long way below the mass of the $Z$ boson then $\\theta$ has a distribution of $1+\\cos^2\\theta$. However, as the centre of mass energy of the collision approaches that of the $Z$ boson an asymmetry appears and the distribution becomes $\\cal{A}(1+\\cos^2\\theta) + \\cal{B} \\cos \\theta$ which can be written $(1+\\cos^2\\theta) + \\dfrac{\\cal{B}}{\\cal{A}}\\cos \\theta$. The ratio $\\dfrac{\\cal{B}}{\\cal{A}}= \\kappa$ varies greatly (up to a maximum of ~10%) around the collision energies near the centre of mass of the $Z$ boson and even changes sign. In the 1990s measuring these assymetries was an important scientific goal as they told us much about electroweak unification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 1990s the LEP collider at CERN was one of the first  $e^-e^+$ colliders to run near the $Z$ mass. \n",
    "The aim of the mini-project is to determine how well the experiments could measure $\\kappa$ in three different scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When LEP started running each experiment would collect a few 10s of these events/day and (say) would run for 100 days a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A couple of years later each experiment would collect a few 100s of these events/day and (say) would run for 100 days a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A couple of years later again each experiment would collect a few 1000s of these events/day and (say) would run for 100 days a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should consider (and simulate) three different values for $\\kappa = \\pm 0.07$ and $0$. You should fit your simulation to consider how well you can tell them apart and what precision can you make on the individual measurements. \n",
