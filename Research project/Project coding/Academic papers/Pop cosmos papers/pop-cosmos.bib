	abstract = {We present an efficient Bayesian method for estimating individual photometric redshifts and galaxy properties under a pretrained population model (pop-cosmos) that was calibrated using purely photometric data. This model specifies a prior distribution over 16 stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameters using a score-based diffusion model, and includes a data model with detailed treatment of nebular emission. We use a GPU-accelerated affine-invariant ensemble sampler to achieve fast posterior sampling under this model for 292,300 individual galaxies in the COSMOS2020 catalog, leveraging a neural network emulator (Speculator) to speed up the SPS calculations. We apply both the pop-cosmos population model and a baseline prior inspired by Prospector-α, and compare these results to published COSMOS2020 redshift estimates from the widely used EAZY and LePhare codes. For the ∼12,000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, we find that pop-cosmos yields redshift estimates that have minimal bias (∼10‑4), high accuracy (σ MAD = 7 × 10‑3), and a low outlier rate (1.6\%). We show that the pop-cosmos population model generalizes well to galaxies fainter than its r {\textless} 25 mag training set. The sample we have analyzed is ≳3× larger than has previously been possible via posterior sampling with a full SPS model, with average throughput of 15 GPU-sec per galaxy under the pop-cosmos prior, and 0.6 GPU-sec per galaxy under the Prospector prior. This paves the way for principled modeling of the huge catalogs expected from upcoming Stage IV galaxy surveys.},

We construct a detailed forward model for the COSMOS data, comprising: a population model describing the joint distribution of galaxy characteristics and its evolution (parameterized by a flexible score-based diffusion model); a state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis model connecting galaxies' intrinsic properties to their photometry; and a data model for the observation, calibration, and selection processes. By minimizing the optimal transport distance between synthetic and real data, we are able to jointly fit the population and data models, leading to robustly calibrated population-level inferences that account for parameter degeneracies, photometric noise and calibration, and selection. We present a number of key predictions from our model of interest for cosmology and galaxy evolution, including the mass function and redshift distribution; the mass–metallicity-redshift and fundamental metallicity relations; the star-forming sequence; the relation between dust attenuation and stellar mass, star formation rate, and attenuation-law index; and the relation between gas-ionization and star formation.

	abstract = {We study star formation over 12 Gyr using pop-cosmos, a generative model trained on 26-band photometry of 420,000 COSMOS2020 galaxies (IRAC Ch.1 \${\textless}26\$). The model learns distributions over 16 SPS parameters via score-based diffusion, matching observed colours and magnitudes. We compute the star formation rate density (SFRD) to \$z=3.5\$ by directly integrating individual galaxy SFRs. The SFRD peaks at \$z=1.3{\textbackslash}pm0.1\$, with peak value \$0.08{\textbackslash}pm0.01\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ Mpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$. We classify star-forming (SF) and quiescent (Q) galaxies using specific SFR \${\textless}10{\textasciicircum}\{-11\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, comparing with \$NUVrJ\$ colour selection. The sSFR criterion yields up to 20\% smaller quiescent fractions across \$0{\textless}z{\textless}3.5\$, with \$NUVrJ\$-selected samples contaminated by galaxies with sSFR up to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-9\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Our sSFR-selected stellar mass function shows a negligible number density of low-mass (\${\textless}10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\}\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) Q galaxies at \$z{\textbackslash}sim1\$, where colour-selection shows a prominent increase. Non-parametric star formation histories around the SFRD peak reveal distinct patterns: SF galaxies show gradually decreasing SFR correlations with lookback time (\$r{\textbackslash}sim1\$ to \$r{\textbackslash}sim0\$ over 13 Gyr), implying increasingly stochastic star formation toward early epochs. Q galaxies exhibit full correlation (\$r{\textgreater}0.95\$) during the most recent \${\textbackslash}sim\$300 Myr, then sharp decorrelation with earlier star-forming epochs, marking clear quenching transitions. Massive (\$10{\textless}{\textbackslash}log\_\{10\}(M\_*/\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}){\textless}11\$) galaxies quench on a time-scale of \${\textbackslash}sim1\$ Gyr, with mass assembly concentrated in their first 3.5 Gyr. Finally, AGN activity (infrared luminosity) peaks as massive (\${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\}\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) galaxies approach the transition between star-forming and quiescent states, declining sharply once quiescence is established. This provides evidence that AGN feedback operates in a critical regime during the \${\textbackslash}sim1\$ Gyr quenching transition.},

	abstract = {One of the greatest challenges in galaxy evolution over the last decade has been constraining the prevalence of heavily dust-obscured galaxies in the early Universe. At \$z{\textgreater}3\$, these galaxies are increasingly rare, and difficult to identify as they are interspersed among the more numerous dust-obscured galaxy population at \$z=1-3\$, making efforts to secure confident spectroscopic redshifts expensive, and sometimes unsuccessful. In this work, we present the Extended Mapping Obscuration to Reionization with ALMA (Ex-MORA) Survey -- a 2mm blank-field survey in the COSMOS-Web field, and the largest ever ALMA blank-field survey to-date covering 577 arcmin\${\textasciicircum}2\$. Ex-MORA is an expansion of the MORA survey designed to identify primarily \$z{\textgreater}3\$ dusty, star-forming galaxies while simultaneously filtering out the more numerous \$z{\textless}3\$ population by leveraging the very negative \$K\$-correction at observed-frame 2mm. We identify 37 significant (\${\textgreater}\$5\$σ\$) sources, 33 of which are robust thermal dust emitters. We measure a median redshift of \${\textbackslash}langle z {\textbackslash}rangle = 3.6{\textasciicircum}\{+0.1\}\_\{-0.2\}\$, with two-thirds of the sample at \$z{\textgreater}3\$, and just under half at \$z{\textgreater}4\$, demonstrating the overall success of the 2mm-selection technique. The integrated \$z{\textgreater}3\$ volume density of Ex-MORA sources is \${\textbackslash}sim1-3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ Mpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, consistent with other surveys of infrared luminous galaxies at similar epochs. We also find that techniques using rest-frame optical emission (or lack thereof) to identify \$z{\textgreater}3\$ heavily dust-obscured galaxies miss at least half of Ex-MORA galaxies. This supports the idea that the dusty galaxy population is heterogeneous, and that synergies across observatories spanning multiple energy regimes are critical to understanding their formation and evolution at \$z{\textgreater}3\$.},

	abstract = {Using a compilation of 25 studies from the literature, we investigate the evolution of the star-forming galaxy (SFG) main sequence (MS) in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) out to z ∼ 6. After converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a remarkable consensus among MS observations (∼0.1 dex 1σ interpublication scatter). By fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bin. After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is ∼0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best-fit log SFR(M*, t) = (0.84 ± 0.02 − 0.026 ± 0.003 × t)log M* − (6.51 ± 0.24 − 0.11 ± 0.03 × t), where t is the age of the universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-τ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a “typical” MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial 1σ spread in formation times of ∼1.4 Gyr.},
