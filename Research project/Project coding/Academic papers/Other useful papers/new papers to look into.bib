	abstract = {Principled Bayesian inference of galaxy properties has not previously been performed for wide-area weak lensing surveys with millions of sources. We address this gap by applying the pop-cosmos generative model to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting for 4 million KiDS-1000 galaxies. Calibrated on deep COSMOS2020 photometric data, pop-cosmos specifies a physically-motivated prior over the galaxy population up to \$z {\textbackslash}simeq 6\$ in stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameter space. Using the Speculator SPS emulator with GPU-accelerated MCMC sampling, we perform full posterior inference at 6.5 GPU seconds per galaxy, obtaining joint constraints on galaxy redshifts and physical properties. We validate photometric redshifts against \${\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash}!185,{\textbackslash}!000\$ KiDS galaxies cross-matched to DESI DR1 spectroscopic samples, achieving low bias (\$3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$), scatter (\$σ\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{MAD\}\}=0.04\$), and outlier fraction (3.7\%) for the Bright Galaxy Survey, with comparable performance (bias \$3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$, \$σ\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{MAD\}\}=0.05\$, 1.3\% outliers) for luminous red galaxies (LRGs). Within the LRG sample, we identify massive, dusty, star-forming contaminants at \$z {\textbackslash}simeq 0.4\$ satisfying standard colour selections for quenched populations. We infer trends in stellar mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust across five tomographic redshift bins consistent with established scaling relations. Using specific star formation rate constraints, we identify \${\textbackslash}sim\$10\% of KiDS-1000 galaxies as quenched, versus 37\% implied by conservative colour cuts. This enables the construction of weak lensing samples defined by physical properties while mitigating intrinsic alignment systematics and preserving statistical power. Our analysis validates pop-cosmos out-of-sample, establishing it as a scaleable approach for galaxy evolution and cosmological analyses in photometric surveys.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of the cosmological constraints from Stage{\textasciitilde}IV galaxy surveys will be limited by how well the galaxy redshift distributions can be inferred. We have addressed this challenging problem for the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) cosmic shear sample by developing a forward-modeling framework with two main ingredients: (1) the {\textbackslash}texttt\{pop-cosmos\} generative model for the evolving galaxy population, calibrated on {\textbackslash}textit\{Spitzer\} IRAC \${\textbackslash}textit\{Ch.{\textbackslash},1\}{\textless}26\$ galaxies from COSMOS2020; and (2) a data model for noise and selection, machine-learned from the SURFS-based KiDS-Legacy-Like Simulations (SKiLLS). Applying KiDS tomographic binning to our synthetic photometric data, we infer redshift distributions in each of five bins directly from the population and data models, bypassing the need for spectroscopic reweighting. Keeping the data model fixed, we compare results using two different galaxy population models: {\textbackslash}texttt\{pop-cosmos\}; and {\textbackslash}texttt\{shark\}, the semi-analytic galaxy formation model used in SKiLLS. In the first (\$0.1{\textless}z{\textless}0.3\$) and last (\$0.9{\textless}z{\textless}1.2\$) tomographic bins we find systematic differences in the mean redshifts of \$Δz{\textbackslash}sim0.05\$-\$0.1\$, comparable to the reported uncertainties from spectroscopic reweighting methods. This work paves the way for accurate redshift distribution calibration for Stage{\textasciitilde}IV surveys directly through forward modeling, thus providing an independent cross-check on spectroscopic-based calibrations which avoids their selection biases and incompleteness. We will use the {\textbackslash}texttt\{pop-cosmos\} redshift distributions in an upcoming full KiDS cosmology reanalysis.},

              The Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) has become a cornerstone of extragalactic astronomy. Since the last public catalog in 2015, a wealth of new imaging and spectroscopic data have been collected in the COSMOS field. This paper describes the collection, processing, and analysis of these new imaging data to produce a new reference photometric redshift catalog. Source detection and multiwavelength photometry are performed for 1.7 million sources across the 2 deg
              2
              of the COSMOS field, ∼966,000 of which are measured with all available broadband data using both traditional aperture photometric methods and a new profile-fitting photometric extraction tool,
              The Farmer
              , which we have developed. A detailed comparison of the two resulting photometric catalogs is presented. Photometric redshifts are computed for all sources in each catalog utilizing two independent photometric redshift codes. Finally, a comparison is made between the performance of the photometric methodologies and of the redshift codes to demonstrate an exceptional degree of self-consistency in the resulting photometric redshifts. The
              i
              {\textless} 21 sources have subpercent photometric redshift accuracy and even the faintest sources at 25 {\textless}
              i
              {\textless} 27 reach a precision of 5\%. Finally, these results are discussed in the context of previous, current, and future surveys in the COSMOS field. Compared to COSMOS2015, it reaches the same photometric redshift precision at almost one magnitude deeper. Both photometric catalogs and their photometric redshift solutions and physical parameters will be made available through the usual astronomical archive systems (ESO Phase 3, IPAC-IRSA, and CDS).},
