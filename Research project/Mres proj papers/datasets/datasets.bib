	abstract = {Context. Single-dish far-infrared (far-IR) and sub-millimetre (sub-mm) point source catalogues and their connections with galaxy catalogues at other wavelengths are of paramount importance to studying galaxy evolution. However, due to the large mismatch in spatial resolution, cross-matching galaxies detected at different wavelengths is not straightforward. Aims: This work aims to develop the next-generation deblended far-IR and sub-mm catalogues in deep extragalactic survey fields, by extracting photometry at the positions of known sources. We present the first application of our methodology in the COSMOS field. Methods: Our progressive deblending used the Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC)-based Bayesian probabilistic framework known as XID+. The deblending process started from the Spitzer/MIPS 24 μm data, using an initial prior list composed of sources selected from the COSMOS2020 catalogue and radio catalogues from the VLA and the MeerKAT surveys, based on spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling which predicts fluxes of the known sources at the deblending wavelength. To speed up flux prediction, we made use of a neural network-based emulator. After deblending the 24 μm data, we proceeded to the Herschel PACS (100 and 160 μm) and SPIRE wavebands (250, 350 and 500 μm). Each time we constructed a tailor-made prior list based on the predicted fluxes of the known sources, taking into account the deblended photometry from the previous steps. Results: Using simulated far-IR and sub-mm sky, we detailed the performance of our deblending pipeline. After validation with simulations, we then deblended the real observations from 24 to 500 μm and compared with blindly extracted catalogues and previous versions of deblended catalogues. As an additional test, we deblended the SCUBA-2 850 μm map and compared our deblended fluxes with ALMA measurements, demonstrating a higher level of flux accuracy compared to previous results. We publicly release our XID+ deblended point source catalogues, including best estimates and posterior probability distribution functions. These deblended long-wavelength data, which are cross-matched with multi-band photometry by construction, are crucial for studies such as deriving the fraction of dust-obscured star formation and better separation of quiescent galaxies from dusty star-forming galaxies.

	abstract = {We present a “super-deblended” far-infrared (FIR) to (sub)millimeter photometric catalog in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS), prepared with the method recently developed by Liu et al., with key adaptations. We obtain point-spread function fitting photometry at fixed prior positions including 88,008 galaxies detected in VLA 1.4, 3 GHz, and/or MIPS 24 μm images. By adding a specifically carved mass-selected sample (with an evolving stellar mass limit), a highly complete prior sample of 194,428 galaxies is achieved for deblending FIR/(sub)mm images. We performed “active” removal of nonrelevant priors at FIR/(sub)mm bands using spectral energy distribution fitting and redshift information. In order to cope with the shallower COSMOS data, we subtract from the maps the flux of faint nonfitted priors and explicitly account for the uncertainty of this step. The resulting photometry (including data from Spitzer, Herschel, SCUBA2, AzTEC, MAMBO, and NSF’s Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 3 and 1.4 GHz) displays well-behaved quasi-Gaussian uncertainties calibrated from Monte Carlo simulations and tailored to observables (crowding, residual maps). Comparison to ALMA photometry for hundreds of sources provides a remarkable validation of the technique. We detect 11,220 galaxies over the 100-1200 μm range extending to z phot ∼ 7. We conservatively selected a sample of 85 z {\textgreater} 4 high-redshift candidates significantly detected in the FIR/(sub)mm, often with secure radio and/or Spitzer/IRAC counterparts. This provides a chance to investigate the first generation of vigorous starburst galaxies (SFRs ∼ 1000 M ⊙ yr-1). The photometric and value-added catalogs are publicly released.},

	abstract = {Ultra-deep radio surveys are an invaluable probe of dust-obscured star formation, but require a clear understanding of the relative contribution from radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to be used to their fullest potential. We study the composition of the μJy radio population detected in the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array COSMOS-XS survey based on a sample of 1540 sources detected at 3 GHz over an area of ∼350 arcmin2. This ultra-deep survey consists of a single pointing in the well-studied COSMOS field at both 3 and 10 GHz and reaches rms sensitivities of 0.53 and 0.41 μJy beam-1, respectively. We find multiwavelength counterparts for 97\% of radio sources, based on a combination of near-UV/optical to sub-millimeter data, and through a stacking analysis at optical/near-IR wavelengths we further show that the sources lacking such counterparts are likely to be high-redshift in nature (typical z ∼ 4-5). Utilizing the multiwavelength data over COSMOS, we identify AGNs through a variety of diagnostics and find these to make up 23.2 ± 1.3\% of our sample, with the remainder constituting uncontaminated star-forming galaxies. However, more than half of the AGNs exhibit radio emission consistent with originating from star formation, with only 8.8 ± 0.8\% of radio sources showing a clear excess in radio luminosity. At flux densities of ∼30 μJy at 3 GHz, the fraction of star formation-powered sources reaches ∼90\%, and this fraction is consistent with unity at even lower flux densities. Overall, our findings imply that ultra-deep radio surveys such as COSMOS-XS constitute a highly effective means of obtaining clean samples of star formation-powered radio sources.},

	abstract = {We present COSMOS2025, the COSMOS-Web catalog of photometry, morphology, photometric redshifts, and physical parameters for more than 700 000 galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field. This catalog is based on our James Webb Space Telescope 255 h COSMOS-Web program, which provides deep near-infrared imaging in four NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) and one MIRI (F770W) filter over the central {\textasciitilde}0.54 deg2 ({\textasciitilde}0.2 deg2 for MIRI) in COSMOS. These data are combined with ground- and space-based data to derive photometric measurements of NIRCam-detected sources using both fixed-aperture photometry (on the space-based bands) and a profile-fitting technique on all 37 bands spanning 0.3 μm to 8 μm. We provide morphology for all sources from complementary techniques including profile fitting and machine-learning classification. We derive photometric redshifts, physical parameters, and non-parametric star formation histories from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. The catalog has been extensively validated against previous COSMOS catalogs and other surveys. Photometric redshift accuracy measured using spectroscopically confirmed galaxies out to z {\textasciitilde} 9 reaches σMAD = 0.012 at mF444W {\textless} 28 and remains at σMAD ≲ 0.03 as a function of magnitude, color, and galaxy type. This represents a factor of {\textasciitilde}2 improvement at 26 AB mag compared to COSMOS2020. The catalog is approximately 80\% complete at log(M⋆/M⊙) {\textasciitilde} 9 at z {\textasciitilde} 10 and at log(M⋆/M⊙) {\textasciitilde} 7 at z {\textasciitilde} 0.2, representing a gain of 1 dex compared to COSMOS2020. COSMOS2025 represents the definitive COSMOS-Web catalog. It is provided with complete documentation, together with redshift probability distributions, and it is ready for scientific exploitation today.},

The survey is the combination of 56 new observations obtained as an X-ray Visionary Project with the previous C-COSMOS survey. We describe the reduction and analysis of the new observations and the properties of 2273 point sources detected above a spurious probability of 2 × 10-5. We also present the updated properties of the C-COSMOS sources detected in the new data. The whole survey includes 4016 point sources (3814, 2920 and 2440 in the full, soft, and hard band). The limiting depths are 2.2 × 10-16, 1.5 × 10-15, and 8.9 × 10-16 \{{\textbackslash}text\{erg cm\}\}-2 \{\{\{s\}\}\}-1 in the 0.5-2, 2-10, and 0.5-10 keV bands, respectively. The observed fraction of obscured active galactic nuclei with a column density {\textgreater}1022 cm-2 from the hardness ratio (HR) is ∼50\{\}-16+17\%. Given the large sample we compute source number counts in the hard and soft bands, significantly reducing the uncertainties of 5\%-10\%. For the first time we compute number counts for obscured (HR {\textgreater} -0.2) and unobscured (HR {\textless} -0.2) sources and find significant differences between the two populations in the soft band. Due to the unprecedent large exposure, COSMOS-Legacy area is three times larger than surveys at similar depths and its depth is three times fainter than surveys covering similar areas. The area-flux region occupied by COSMOS-Legacy is likely to remain unsurpassed for years to come.},

	abstract = {The COSMOS Spitzer survey (S-COSMOS) is a Legacy program (Cycles 2+3) designed to carry out a uniform deep survey of the full 2 deg2 COSMOS field in all seven Spitzer bands (3.6, 4.5, 5.6, 8.0, 24.0, 70.0, and 160.0 μm). This paper describes the survey parameters, mapping strategy, data reduction procedures, achieved sensitivities to date, and the complete data set for future reference. We show that the observed infrared backgrounds in the S-COSMOS field are within 10\% of the predicted background levels. The fluctuations in the background at 24 μm have been measured and do not show any significant contribution from cirrus, as expected. In addition, we report on the number of asteroid detections in the low Galactic latitude COSMOS field. We use the Cycle 2 S-COSMOS data to determine preliminary number counts, and compare our results with those from previous Spitzer Legacy surveys (e.g., SWIRE, GOODS). The results from this ``first analysis'' confirm that the S-COSMOS survey will have sufficient sensitivity with IRAC to detect {\textasciitilde}L* disks and spheroids out to z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}3, and with MIPS to detect ultraluminous starbursts and AGNs out to z{\textasciitilde}3 at 24 μm and out to z{\textasciitilde}1.5-2 at 70 and 160 μm.
